TIPS FOR MAKING THIS CUSTARD CAKE:
* Your baking time WILL vary depending on the temperature of your ingredients.
Some people may find they need to cook their cakes for up to an hour.

*I cook this cake in a 20cm square baking tin, you can use a different size tin but the cooking time will vary.

*The mixture will look lumpy and you may be convinced that it won’t work out –
keep going as the end result is worth it!

*When testing to see if your cake is ready, you do want there to be some ‘jiggle’ in the middle still.

*I try to put my eggs out the night before I’m planning to make this cake to ensure that they are at room temperature.

*I also heat the milk in a microwave safe jug until it’s just warm.

*To serve, I prefer to let this cake cool completely in the tin
(you can also pop it in the fridge when cool enough to do so) and then dust with icing sugar and cut into pieces.

*This cake is best stored in an airtight container in your fridge and enjoyed within 3 – 4 days.
